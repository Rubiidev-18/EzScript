# EzScript
A programming language that compiles to HTML, written entirely in Python, meant to simplify website coding.  
Heres an example of ezscript:  
```
<title> cool ezscript website
<heading> this is a heading
<text> yo
```
the code then compiles to html.

```
<title>cool ezscript website</title>
<h1 style="font-family: Arial;">this is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-family: Arial;">yo</p>
```
